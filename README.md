<br><br>

### Problem statement:<br>
In this project I am scraping hotels' data from booking.com for top ten world's most-visited cities in 2018, the data frame contains 85-100 hotels per city, futhermore it is expected that the some cities in the list will be again the in the list of world's most-visited cities in 2019 for example for the fourth consecutive year, Bangkok topped the cities index with the most international overnight visitorsâ€“ 22 million in all. Coming up at numbers two and three were Paris and London, respectively, with around 19 million international overnight visitors each. In short this data frame will be useful for the next coming years.<br>
